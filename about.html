Yo! I'm a Nigerian-American producer in the US who makes Electronic Music, Trap and does art. I've been making music digitally for about 3 or 4 years now and playing instruments for 7+ years. I'm always open for collaborations at dxsbond@gmail.com but I'm currently a tad bit swamped with schoolwork and my shedule is overflowing so it would probably be best if you waited a bit to send in any collaboration requests. As a side hobby I also enjoy programming games, websites and any kind of artistic visuals I come up with. I managed to make this website and my Itch.io link is also on the home page (I only have one game uploaded though XD). Given time I'm going to remodel my soundcloud (and begin to use a different account for serious music) and I am also going to create a new Spotify as I'm not satisfied with what I've currently come up with or done. I'll be creating a discord server in the near future so be sure to drop by and say hi! Thanks!
